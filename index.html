					<h3>12 (contradicting) rules for</h3>
					<h1>METRICS</h1>
					<p><small>Created by <a href="mailto:monica.turiac@endava.com">Monica Turiac</a></small></p>
					<p></p><small>Based on a true book by <a href="http://jurgenappelo.com/about/">Jurgen Apello</a></small></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #1: Measure for a purpose</h2>
						<p class="fragment">What gets measured gets managed, and what gets managed gets done. It’s a cliché because it’s true!</p>
						<p class="fragment">You must always understand why you are measuring. The metric is not a goal in itself. Never forget that it’s just a means to an end. It all starts with why.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- Example of nested vertical slides -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #2: Shrink the unknown</h2>
						<p class="fragment">A metric is just a surrogate for what you really want to know. Don’t jump to conclusions. Always try to reduce the size of what is still unknown.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>A single number indicating health does not exist. Neither does one single value for happiness, or for most other qualities for that matter</p>
						<p>We can at least reduce our ignorance by using multiple imperfect metrics. But don't jump to conclusions.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #3: Seek to improve</h2>
						<p class = "fragment">Don’t only measure things that will make you look good. There is plenty of data around, but you must focus on what enables you to do better work.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="http://cdn.footballmanagerstory.com/wp-content/uploads/pics/2011/10/fm-2012-arsenal-tactic-swansea-result.png"/>
						<p>Not all metrics are created equal</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #4: Delight all stakeholders</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Your work depends on others, and others depend on you. Never optimize for just one stakeholder. Instead, measure your work from multiple perspectives.</>
						<p class="fragment">The ultimate test of agility is whether you can keep all your stakeholders happy: customers and employees, owners and suppliers</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #5: Distrust all numbers</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Observers usually influence their own metrics, and they suffer from all kinds of biases. Have a healthy, skeptical attitude towards any reported numbers.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Hawthorne Effect: The fact that a person’s productivity is being measured causes that person to pay more attention to his work and his productivity goes up.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #6: Set imprecise targets</h2>
						<p class="fragment">“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”</p>
						<p class="fragment">As soon as you set a target for others, they will pursue the target instead of the original purpose</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="http://sd.keepcalm-o-matic.co.uk/i/keep-calm-and-log-a-ticket-33.png"/>
						<p>Most support have targets/get rewarded for number of tickets solved.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #7: Own your metrics</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Everyone is responsible for their own work, and metrics help us improve that work. Therefore, everyone should be responsible for their own metrics.</p>
						<p class="fragment">The metrics are available for people’s self-improvement rather than for managerial coercion and control.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">Managers: Before you try to measure someone else’s performance, please explain how you measure your own.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Individual Contributors: See measurement as a positive thing, as something that empowers you to improve your work and your outcomes in the areas under your control.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #8: Don’t connect metrics to rewards</h2>
						<p class="fragment">What is rewarded (and can be measured) is never exactly the same as the true purpose of the organization (which cannot be truly measured).</p>
						<p class="fragment">Rewards kill motivation and lead to dysfunctional behaviours: for every person you make “employee of the month” you turn dozens, hundreds, or thousands of colleagues into “losers of the month”.</p>

					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #9: Promote values and transparency</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Human beings are smart and able to game any system. To prevent gaming, be transparent about values, intentions, and the metrics everyone is using.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>At Google, employees add their objectives and targets into the employee directory and everyone can see each other’s results, including those of the top managers. [Yarow, “This Is the Internal Grading System Google Uses”]</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #10: Visualize and humanize</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Numbers tend to dehumanize everything. Replace digits with colors and pictures, and keep the measurements close to where the actual work is done.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #11: Measure early and often </h2>
						<p class="fragment"> Don’t delay measurements until symptoms of problems are popping up. If you don’t have regular check-ups, your diagnostics and interventions might be too late.</p>
						<p class="fragment"> Measuring well usually means measuring more often than you’re doing now. <p>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>RULE #12: Try something else </h2>
						<p class="fragment">It’s rarely a good idea to do the same things over and over. The environment changes all the time. The same should apply to how and what you measure.<p>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>WHAT NEXT?</h2>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Learn about Google’s OKRs system for performance measurements and start experimenting with a similar system yourself.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Evaluate the things you measure regularly and see if they help you learn to improve toward your purpose.</li>
							<li class="fragment">List all your stakeholders (the teams and groups you belong to) and check if you measure your performance for each of their perspectives.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Visualize your metrics in a way that makes them interesting, and keep them close</li>
							<li class="fragment">Be transparent about your metrics. Show them to others and ask the same courtesy from them. Discuss it all together, and feel free to collaborate and compete on measures.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Now scale this to the whole organization, where everyone maintains responsibility for their own measurements.</li>
						</ol>
